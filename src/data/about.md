# Intro

Experienced Business Intelligence Analyst with a demonstrated history of success in the government industry, I specialise in transforming raw information into actionable insights.

My expertise spans data analysis, visualisation, and storytelling, honed over years of working with complex datasets.

A key strength is my command of the Power Platform, where I've utilised ETL processes to craft dynamic, interactive dashboards that empower decision-makers.
 
My work in government settings, coupled with collaboration with financial teams, has delivered impactful solutions, improving data-driven strategies. 

Motivated by a passion for problem-solving, I continuously strive to leverage data for meaningful business outcomes.

At home, I'm a proud parent, constantly learning how to balance family life with my professional aspirations. My family is my biggest source of motivation, pushing me to continuously excel in all areas of life.

# Some History

- Born and raised in Cardiff, Wales, I grew up with a passion for technology and problem-solving.
- During primary school I was enrolled in not only Wales', but the UK's first curriculum lessons in the teaching of safe and responsible use of the Internet.
- These lessons ignited my deep interest for computing, from a young age I was creating HTML websites (Looking very 90s etc with flash intergration).
- While my computing skills developed, my childhood naughtiness also did, where I my obsession with programming led me to skipping other lessons, making myself very known in our IT departmnents.
- Later in year, I enrolled on to a college course to achieve the basic English and Math qualifications I needed to go to university, after very skipping all my highschool classes.
- Cardiff University, studying Computer Science with Security and Forensics was right up my alley, being able to play around and learn all day everyday, I was in my prime.
- Being poor, and not wanting to get a real job I joined the Territorial Army while studying, where I met the most amazing people and learn life and team-building lessons which I truely belive I could not have anywhere else.
- After Univerisity I had to join the real world, getting a work experience/apprenticeship role in Cyber Security.
- Once the contract ended for this, the next couple of years here I allocated to having fun, travelling and making the most of life.
- Following this, home and in desperate need of quick cash, I joined the Local Authority working on Benefits and helping Wales poorest claim, allowing them to have the best chance at a life as possible.
- This path progrssed into the Civil Service working as a caseworker for HMRC, where I quickly progressed, with LOTS! of studing about laws and legislation which I knew nothing about. I got promoted into a Tax Profressional.
- My wife started her doctorate in Cornwall, which ment picking up our whole life and trying something new.
- Now, not so desperate for cash, I took this as an oppertunity to pivot my career back to what I know and love, computing!
- Well mostly... I joined the Local Authorities social care data team, where I knew next to nothing about data reporting and the computer languages that come with this.
- To my relief, even though it had been a fair few years since I practiced programming, it all came back to me like a wave, bringing my back to my younger days when this kickstarted my passion for studing and IT once again.
- I quickly grew my skills in SQL and the Power Platform, making high quality reports for decision makers.
- Along-side full-time employment, I joined the Open university part time studying Cisco, Computer networking.
- Following review of my Power BI skills, I was reached out to from the Cornwall College Group where they offered me a position to join them, where they were just starting their Power Platform lifecycle and dynamic reporting.
-I am still with the college, making high quality reports, where the UK's Ofsted commisioners have quoted that our Power BI reporting is some of the best in the country they have seen.
